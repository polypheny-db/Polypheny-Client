# Polypheny Client

_Polypheny Client_ is a client for querying Polypheny-DB. It connects to Polypheny-DB via JDBC using the [JDBC Driver](https://github.com/polypheny/Polypheny-JDBC-Driver).

This client contains a [Chronos](https://github.com/chronos-eaas) connector. This allows to easily execute evaluation campaigns.


## Getting Started ##
Download the latest [polypheny-client.jar](https://github.com/polypheny/Polypheny-Client/releases/latest) from the release section. 
To start the query console, execute `polypheny-client.jar` by specifying the parameter `console` and the _hostname_ or _IP address_ of a running Polypheny-DB instance.

```
java -jar polypheny-client.jar console localhost
```
